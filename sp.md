ObjectBox Support Services Policy
=================================

**Effective Date: July 2020**

This ObjectBox Support Services Policy (“Policy”) is the primary document used to communicate ObjectBox’s (“we/us/our”) support policies to licensees of ObjectBox Software (each a “Customer”, or “you/your”), including ObjectBox’s Commercial Software and ObjectBox Community Software. As referenced in either the licence under which you obtain and are granted the right to use ObjectBox’s Commercial Software and/or the agreement under which you obtain a subscription (“Subscription”) from ObjectBox or through a Reseller to ObjectBox’s Support Services (in each case, the relevant “Agreement”), this Support Services Policy sets forth ObjectBox’s support terms and conditions, and provides a description of ObjectBox’s technical support levels. Capitalized terms that are not defined in this document carry the definition set forth in the applicable Agreement. This Policy is incorporated into your Agreement with us either directly or by reference.

## 1. Scope of Support Services.



The scope of the Support Services provided to Customer and/or the Customer’s third party IT contractors (where requested by the Customer) includes general assistance and support regarding the installation of the Commercial Software and basic technical configuration of the Commercial Software, as well as developer assistance regarding how to use the Commercial Software. ObjectBox will provide Support Services to Customer in accordance with, and subject to, this Support Service Policy and your compliance with the Agreement(s). 

## 2.	Support Services Offerings.


ObjectBox offers three different levels of the Support Services which are defined in Section 3 of this Support Level Agreement, and are subject to the specific terms and conditions established therein regarding hours of operation, response times, methods of support, available remedies and other matters for each Subscription Level. ObjectBox shall use commercially reasonable efforts to meet the applicable targeted response times set forth below, but the Customer acknowledges these are estimates only, not guaranteed, time is not of the essence and the Customer’s remedies where these times are missed by us are as stated in section 9 and the relevant Agreement. Customer acknowledges that the time required for resolution of issues may vary depending on the specific circumstances of each problem, including, and without limitation: the nature of the incident/problem, the extent and accuracy of information available about the incident/problem, and the level of Customer’s cooperation and responsiveness in providing materials, information, access and support reasonably required by ObjectBox to achieve the problem resolution.


## 3.	Subscription Levels.


For all support requests, send an email to ![support email](images/email-support.png).
In any case, the submission needs to be set up prior to engaging an ObjectBox resource. Once the appropriate support request is filed, the most optimal method of contact may be utilized (phone, web interface, email), subject to the applicable Subscription Level. Severity Level 1 and 2 issues must be filed via the web interface. Severity Level 3 issues may be filed via email or the web interface. All e-mail based production tickets will be treated as Severity Level 3.
Support is only provided up to the number of Billable Devices and/or ObxSync Instances in the Subscription.

**Definition of terms**:

“Business Day” means Monday through Friday except for national holidays in the place from which Support Services may be provided (as notified to you by us); the default place from which Support Services are provided is Germany.

“Incident” means a single question or issue posed by a Support Contact using the Support Services.

“Support Contact” means a single named individual that is authorized to contact ObjectBox on your behalf to make use of the Support Services.

The default time zone for Normal Hours of Operation is CET (unless we notify you otherwise).

## 4.	Severity Level Definitions.


**Level 1**

A Level 1 issue involves a major production error within the Commercial Software that severely impacts the Customer’s use of the Commercial Software for production purposes, for example, the loss of production data or an instance where production systems are not functioning and no work-around exists. ObjectBox will use continuous efforts during the Normal Hours of Operation stated above for the applicable Subscription Level to provide resolution support for any Level 1 errors as soon as is commercially reasonable.

**Level 2**

A Level 2 issue involves an error within the Commercial Software where the Customer’s system is functioning for production purposes but in a reduced capacity, for example, a problem that is causing significant impact to portions of the Customer’s business operations and productivity, or where the Commercial Software is exposed to potential loss or interruption of service. ObjectBox will use continuous reasonable efforts during the Normal Hours of Operation stated above for the applicable Subscription Level to provide resolution support for any Level 2 errors.

**Level 3**

A Level 3 issue involves a medium-to-low impact error that involves either partial and/or non-critical loss of functionality for production purposes or development purposes, such as a problem that impairs some operations but allows the Customer’s operations to continue to function. Level 3 also includes errors for which there is limited or no loss or functionality or impact to the Customer’s operation and for which there is an easy work-around. ObjectBox will use reasonable efforts to provide resolution support for any Level 3 error in time for an upcoming release of Commercial Software. All inbound production email cases shall have an initial status of Level 3.

## 5.	Customer Obligations.


Customer must provide a functional Project/Application description at time of order to clearly define the Project/Application ObjectBox will be supporting. Customer is responsible for ensuring that its employees interacting with ObjectBox have sufficient English language and technical skills, and respond to and cooperate with ObjectBox in a timely manner in connection with requests for Support Services. ObjectBox cannot be in breach of this Policy or the applicable Agreement where any failure or delay is caused by the Customer’s breach of this section 5.

When requesting Support Services from ObjectBox, the following preconditions apply: Customer agrees to (and to oblige each of its developers to) use reasonable efforts to: (i) attempt to resolve the problem and to utilize sufficient resources to clearly understand that a problem exists before consulting ObjectBox and promptly provide such evidence of such steps to ObjectBox in writing as ObjectBox reasonably requires; (ii) provide ObjectBox with sufficient information and technical data to allow ObjectBox to establish that a potential problem is not the kind of problem that is an exclusion from the Support Services; (iii) make reasonable attempts and use reasonable resources to provide any data reasonably requested by ObjectBox to sufficiently address the potential problem; (iv) utilize adequate resources to understand the instructions from ObjectBox in addressing the problem, and make reasonable attempts to correct the problem as suggested by ObjectBox and (v) not take any action that is inconsistent with instructions given to it by ObjectBox. In addition, Customer agrees and acknowledges that the extent of access and the accuracy of information and technical data provided may affect ObjectBox’s ability to provide the Support Services.

CUSTOMER AGREES NOT TO USE THE SUPPORT SERVICES IN ANY WAY THAT IS PROHIBITED BY THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEVELOPMENT, DEPLOYMENT, ENABLEMENT AND/OR MAINTENANCE OF ANY NON-OBJECTBOX SOFTWARE THAT COMPETES WITH OBJECTBOX’S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

## 6.	Support Service Exclusions.


ObjectBox will have no obligation to provide Support Services to Customer if (i) the ObjectBox Software has been changed, modified or damaged by Customer or anyone other than ObjectBox, (ii) the problem is caused by Customer’s negligence, misconduct, or misuse of the ObjectBox Software, a hardware malfunction, or other causes beyond the reasonable control of ObjectBox, (iii) the problem is due to third party software, (iv) the ObjectBox Software is being hosted by a third party that is offering the ObjectBox Software as a service (v) Customer has not installed or implemented any Software releases made generally available or is not running a then supported version of the ObjectBox Software as provided by ObjectBox as defined in Section 7 or (vi) information requested by Customer could reasonably be expected to assist in the development, deployment, enablement and/or maintenance of any non-ObjectBox Software that competes with ObjectBox’s Software products. The Support Services do not cover the support of any third party software which integrates with the ObjectBox Software. In addition, the Support Services do not include the following: (a) use of any version of a Software that is not designated as a production release (such as a milestone or release candidate or code contained in the sandbox or any other repository that is not packaged into a production release distribution); (b) Customer’s failure to comply with any operating instructions contained in the documentation, or other guidance, instructions or directions issued to the Customer by ObjectBox (from time to time); (c) installation, configuration, management and operation of Customer’s applications; (d) APIs, interfaces or data formats other than those included with the ObjectBox Software; or (e) any training. In addition, Support Services are available only for one Project/Application per Agreement and may not be used at all for Production systems where “Production” means the system is using/processing live data.

## 7.	Version Support.


ObjectBox will provide Support Services as follows:

**7.1** We use a three-place numbering scheme to uniquely name released versions of the ObjectBox Software. The format is MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, where ‘MAJOR’ indicates a major enhancement of the ObjectBox Software, ‘MINOR’ indicates minor enhancements of the ObjectBox Software, for example but not limited to new functionalities, and ‘PATCH’ indicates maintenance / bug fixes. An example would be version 2.0.1. Often in referring to general software versions and releases, the maintenance level is omitted. For example, both 2.0.1 and 2.0.2 may sometimes be referred to as Version 2.0.

Each MAJOR level release will be supported for eighteen (18) months from the date the Version is initially released (as stated in the documentation). Support for each Version is supplied via Maintenance Fixes (PATCH level). ObjectBox will fix errors only in the most current PATCH level for the most current MINOR version of the ObjectBox Software. Support Services will direct Customers to existing fixes/patches and workarounds applicable to the reported case, and may direct Customers to upgrade to a more current MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH of the Objectbox Software. Once applicable, you will find the End of Life table for ObjectBox products online.

**7.2** If support for a Version would normally expire under Section 7.1 and no later Version has been released, support for the old Version will be extended until the date that is thirty (30) days after the date on which a new Version is released.

**7.3** If support for a Version would normally expire under Section 7.1, and no further Versions are planned, a Software may be end-of-life. Where this happens, you may continue to use the relevant Version, but no further Support Services or releases are offered to you by us. 

## 8.	Supported Platforms


A number of platform and software configurations are eligible for ObjectBox Support Services. Contact us to find out if your platform and software configuration meets the eligibility criteria.

## 9.	Breach of this Policy


Where you are in breach of any provision of your Agreement (either with us or our Reseller), we may suspend performance of the Support Services to you under this Policy until such time as the relevant breach has been remedied. Our obligation to perform the Support Services will cease from the time that your Agreement with us terminates (for any reason at any time), and our liability to you in those circumstances in relation to the Support Services will be as stated in that Agreement. A breach of this Policy by you may entitle us to terminate your Agreement with us in full.

Where we are in breach of, or fail to meet our obligations under, this Policy at any time, your sole remedy in respect of that breach or failure will be for us to re-perform the applicable Support Services as soon as practicable.

## 10.	General 


Subject to the rest of this section 10, we may modify this Policy at any time, including during your Subscription Term, without your consent if the change is non-material (as determined by us) and it does not diminish the level of support services you have paid for. Where this happens we may notify you, but you are advised to check back regularly for the applicable version of this Policy that applies to you. We reserve the right to modify this Policy and the Support Services you receive where the Support Services are, or are likely to become, subject to an Infringement Claim at any time, in which case the Support Services and/or this Policy will be modified by us so that they are no longer infringing the relevant third party’s rights (which are, or may be, the basis of the relevant Infringement Claim).

We retain archived copies which we can provide to you on request during your Subscription Term, so that you can check which version of this Policy applies, or applied, at the relevant time.

If you have any questions relating to the Support Services and/or this Policy, please either contact us or the Reseller from whom you licensed the Objectbox Software in the first instance. 

The laws governing your Agreement will also govern this Policy.
