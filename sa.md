12.1          <ins>Anti-Corruption.</ins> Each party acknowledges that it is aware of, understands and has complied and will comply with, all applicable U.S. and foreign anti-corruption laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA“) and the U.K. Bribery Act (to the extent applicable).

12.2           <ins>Assignment.</ins> Neither party may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party, provided that no such consent will be required to assign this Agreement in its entirety to (i) an Affiliate that is able to satisfy the obligations of the assignor under this Agreement or (ii) a successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of all or substantially of the assigning party’s assets. Any assignment in violation of this Section 12.2 shall be void and of no effect. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement is binding upon, inures to the benefit of and is enforceable by, the parties and their respective permitted successors and assigns.

12.3           <ins>Customer Identification.</ins> Customer consents to ObjectBox’ identification of the Customer as a user of the Software and the Support Services, on its website, through a press release issued by ObjectBox and in other promotional materials. ObjectBox will not disclose any Customer Personal Data at any time in connection with the rights granted under this section 12.3.

12.4           <ins>Force Majeure.</ins> Except with respect to payment obligations, subject to the directly affected party’s compliance with the requirements of this section 12.4, neither party will be liable for, or be considered to be in breach of this Agreement, as a result of any event beyond either party’s reasonable control at the relevant time for which the directly affected party is not responsible. Where such an event or circumstance occurs, the directly affected party shall notify the other party of the cause and nature of the event, its likely duration (if known) and its impact on that party’s performance of its obligations under the Agreement (whether it affects its ability to use the Software or provide the Support Services, as applicable). The directly affected party shall also: (i) provide the other party with regular updates during the relevant event; and (ii) take all necessary and reasonable steps to mitigate the effects of the relevant event.

12.5           <ins>Future Features and Functions.</ins> Customer understands and agrees that any features or functions of services or products referenced on any ObjectBox website, or in any presentations, press releases or public statements, which are not currently available to the public on general availability(GA) release, may not be delivered on time or at all. The development, release, and timing of any features or functionality described for the Commercial Software remains at ObjectBox’s sole discretion. Accordingly, Customer agrees that it is purchasing products and services based solely upon features and functions that are currently available as of the time an Order Form is executed, and not in expectation of any future feature or function.

12.6           <ins>Governing Law, Jurisdiction and Venue.</ins> This Agreement will be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, without regard to its conflict of laws principles and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (UNCISG). All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be submitted to the exclusive jurisdiction of a court of competent jurisdiction in Berlin, Germany and each party, irrevocably consents to such personal jurisdiction and waives all objections to this venue. A breach by either party of Section 7 may cause irreparable harm for which the non-breaching party shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief.

12.7         <ins> Non-Solicitation.</ins>

12.7.1 During the Subscription Term, and for a period of twelve (12) months following its expiry or termination, Customer shall not solicit, nor approach in any way, (and shall procure that no Customer Affiliate solicits or approaches) any of ObjectBox’ employees or contract staff directly engaged by ObjectBox in connection with the performance of the Support Services or the servicing of the Customer’s account, with a view to (i) offering such persons, employment, (ii) soliciting services from them on their own account, (iii) encouraging them to provide their services to a third party rather than ObjectBox, or (iv) offering to them the opportunity to perform services that are substantially similar to the Support Services. However, the foregoing restriction shall not apply to any employee or former employee that responds (without specific solicitation) to a general solicitation of general circulation, placement agencies, or similar means.

12.7.2 Where the Customer is in breach of the restrictions contained in sub-section 12.7.1, the Customer shall: (i) pay to ObjectBox an amount equal to one year’s annual salary or remuneration (in connection with soliciting of employees or staff) within 14 days of the relevant employee or staff members start date with the Customer or any Customer Affiliate; or (ii) be liable to ObjectBox for its losses as a result of the breach (in all other cases) in accordance with the provisions of section 10.

12.8 <ins>Notices.</ins> Any notice or other communication under this Agreement given by either party to the other will be deemed to be properly given if given in writing and delivered in person or by e-mail, if acknowledged received by return e-mail or followed within one day by a delivered or mailed copy of such notice, or if mailed, properly addressed and stamped with the required postage, to the intended recipient at its address specified on an Order Form. Notices to ObjectBox may also be sent to ![contact email](images/email-contact.png). Either party may from time to time change its address for notices under this Section by giving the other party notice of the change in accordance with this Section 12.8. If the Customer becomes aware of any actual or threatened activity that is prohibited by this Agreement, the EULA and/or the Licence, the Customer shall (and shall cause its Authorised Users and Contractors to) immediately: (i) take all reasonable and lawful measures within their respective control to stop the activity (or threatened activity) and to mitigate its effects, and (ii) notify ObjectBox as soon as possible upon discovery.
 
12.9 <ins>Non-waiver.</ins> Any failure of either party to insist upon or enforce performance by the other party of any of the provisions of this Agreement or to exercise any rights or remedies under this Agreement will not be interpreted or construed as a waiver or relinquishment of such party’s right to assert or rely upon such provision, right or remedy in that or any other instance unless such waiver is given in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of the waiving party.

12.10 <ins>Relationship of the Parties.</ins> The relationship of the parties hereunder shall be that of independent contractors, and nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to create any employment, agency or fiduciary relationship between the parties. Each party shall be solely responsible for the supervision, direction, control and payment of its personnel, including for taxes, deductions and withholdings, compensation and benefits, and nothing herein will be deemed to result in either party having an employer-employee relationship with the personnel of the other party. Nothing in this Agreement shall authorize the Customer or ObjectBox to make, or enter into any commitments on behalf of, the other at any time.

12.11 <ins>Severability.</ins> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, the relevant provision shall be deemed deleted without affecting the validity or enforceability of the remaining provisions, and the parties undertake to replace the ineffective and deleted provision with one approximating as closely as possible in terms of commercial effect to the original.

12.12 <ins>Suggestions, Ideas and Feedback.</ins> Subject to its obligations under Section 7 of this Agreement (Confidential Information), ObjectBox will be free to use, irrevocably, in perpetuity and for any lawful purpose, all suggestions, ideas and/or feedback (collectively, “**Feedback**“) provided to ObjectBox by Customer, or its Affiliates and their respective employees, Contractors, Authorised Users or other agents, with respect to the Support Services, the Community Software and/or the Commercial Software. The foregoing grant of rights is made without any duty to account to any of the foregoing persons or entities for the use of such Feedback.

12.13 <ins>Entire Agreement; Amendment.</ins> This Agreement, together with any Order Forms executed by the parties, the Licence and the Support Services Policy (each of which is incorporated by reference), constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the subject matter and it supersedes all prior proposals, agreements, or other communications between the parties in full (oral or written) regarding the Customer’s use of the Software and its subject matter generally. In the event of any conflict between the terms and conditions of any of the foregoing documents, the conflict shall be resolved based on the following order of precedence: (i) an applicable Order Form (but only for the specific transaction or Project to which that Order Form relates), (ii) this Agreement; (iii) the Licence; and (iv) the Support Services Policy. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties expressly acknowledge and agree that if Customer issues any purchase orders or similar documents in connection with its purchase of a Subscription, it shall do so only for its own internal, administrative purposes and not with the intent to provide any contractual terms. To the extent that any such additional terms are provided by the Customer, they will have no legal effect unless ObjectBox agrees in writing. Where the terms of this Agreement and/or any other documents referred to in this Agreement, are translated into any other language, the English version shall take priority.

12.14       By entering into this Agreement, whether prior to or following receipt of Customer’s purchase order or any similar document, the parties are hereby expressly showing their intention not to be contractually bound by the contents of any such purchase order or similar document, which are hereby deemed rejected and extraneous to this Agreement, and ObjectBox’s performance of this Agreement shall not amount to: (i) an acceptance by conduct of any terms set out or referred to in the purchase order or similar document; (ii) an amendment of this Agreement, nor (iii) an agreement to amend this Agreement. This Agreement shall not be modified except by a subsequently dated, written amendment that expressly amends this Agreement and which is signed on behalf of ObjectBox and Customer by their duly authorized representatives. The same applies to a change of this written form requirement.




COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENCE
================================

This **COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE LICENCE** (this “**Licence**“) is subject to, and hereby incorporated into, the ObjectBox Subscription Agreement which applies to the Customer as of the start date contained on the Order Form, by ObjectBox and Customer (the “**Agreement**“). This Licence sets forth additional terms and conditions related to Customer’s purchase of one or more Subscriptions from ObjectBox that include a licence to use ObjectBox Commercial Software in a self-managed environment.

1.1 <ins>License Grants.</ins> A list of the Eligible Features and Functions that correspond to each version of the Commercial Software and Subscription Levels may be found at https://www.objectbox.io/subscriptions.

a. **Subscription Licences**. If Customer purchases a Subscription, then, subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement and this Licence, including complete payment of any and all applicable Subscription Fees, ObjectBox grants to Customer during the applicable Subscription Term, and for the restricted scope of this Licence a licence to the Eligible Features and Functions of the Commercial Software that are applicable to the Subscription Level that Customer has purchased, for the number of Billable Devices and / or  ObxSync Instances and for the specific Project for which Customer has purchased such Subscription, to be used by the Customer in the Customer’s own, internal environment. The Subscription Level, the number of Billable Devices and / or ObxSync Instances and specific Project(s) for which Customer has purchased such Subscription, are set forth on the applicable Order Form. Any Authorised Users who use the Billable Devices or access the Software at any time shall do so on the terms of the EULA. Where the Customer purchases a Subscription through a Reseller, additional terms made clear to the Customer by the Reseller at the time of purchase may apply.

b. **Licence Restrictions** The licence granted to the Customer under section 1.1 is granted on a royalty-free, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-assignable (other than in accordance with the Agreement), non-sublicensable basis, to load, run and execute the Software onto Billable Devices and / or  ObxSync Instances for ordinary, lawful business or Project purposes only and only on the terms of the Agreement and this Licence.

1.2 <ins>Download Link, Delivery and Acceptance.</ins> Promptly following the execution of an applicable Order Form, ObjectBox will deliver to the Customer a Download Link that enables the Customer to use the Commercial Software in accordance with the rights granted to it in Section 1.1 of this Licence. For purposes of the applicable Order Form, the Commercial Software will be deemed to have been delivered to Customer upon provision of such Download Link, and the Commercial Software is deemed to be accepted by Customer upon delivery. The Customer shall not disclose, and shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to prevent the disclosure of, or unauthorized access to, the Download Link to third parties (and shall procure that its Authorised Users, Contractors, employees or staff or those employees or staff of its Affiliates take equivalent steps).

1.3 <ins>Reservation of Rights; Restrictions.</ins>

1.3.1 As between ObjectBox and Customer, ObjectBox owns all rights and interests in, and titles to, all Commercial Software and any derivative works thereof.

1.3.2 Except as expressly set forth in Section 1.1 of this Licence, no other licence to the Commercial Software is granted to Customer by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

1.3.3 The Customer will not (and procures that its Authorised Users, Affiliates and all other staff or Contractors will not): (i) reverse engineer or decompile, decrypt, disassemble, attempt to translate or derive the source code, or otherwise reduce any of the Commercial Software (or any portion thereof) to human-readable form, except and only to the minimum extent permitted by applicable law or as otherwise accessed by the Customer in accordance with their Subscription; (ii) deploy more Billable Devices and / or ObxSync Instances than are permitted under an applicable Subscription (other than where notifying ObjectBox in accordance with section 6.3 of the Agreement), (iii) prepare derivative works from, modify, copy or use the Software in any manner (except as expressly permitted herein); (iv) transfer, sell, rent, lease, distribute, sublicense, loan or otherwise transfer the Commercial Software in whole or in part to any third party; (v) except for Customer’s internal business purposes, or as otherwise may be expressly permitted on an applicable Order Form or in another written agreement signed by the parties, use the Software to provide any time-sharing services, software-as-a-service or “SaaS” offering, service bureau services or as part of an application services provider or other service offering to third parties (other than its Affiliates); (vi) circumvent the limitations on use of the Software that are imposed in any way or preserved by any Download Link, (vii) alter or remove any copyright or trademarks and proprietary notices in or on the Software; (viii) deploy the Software on or in connection with any third party infrastructure as a service that includes any Software as a service or (ix) make available to any third party any analysis of the results of operation of the Software (including benchmarking results), without the prior written consent of ObjectBox. The Commercial Software may contain or be provided with third party open source libraries, components, utilities and other open source software (collectively, “**Third Party Open Source Software**“), which Third Party Open Source Software may have applicable licence terms as identified on a website designated by ObjectBox or otherwise provided with the Commercial Software, the Agreement (such as e.g. the Apache Licence or Binary Licence) or any related Documentation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, use of the Third Party Open Source Software shall be subject to the licence terms and conditions applicable to such Third Party Open Source Software, to the extent required by the applicable licensor (which terms shall not restrict the licence rights granted to Customer hereunder, but may contain additional rights).

1.4   <ins>Audit Rights.</ins> Customer agrees that, unless such right is waived in writing by ObjectBox, ObjectBox shall have the right, upon fifteen (15) days’ notice to Customer, to audit Customer’s and any Authorised User’s use of the Commercial Software for compliance with any limitations on Customer’s use of the Commercial Software that are set forth in the Agreement, the Licence or the EULA. Customer agrees to provide ObjectBox with the necessary access to the Commercial Software, any Billable Devices, ObxSync Instances or any related hardware or premises to conduct such an audit either (i) remotely, or (ii) if remote performance is not possible, at Customer’s facilities, during normal business hours and no more than one (1) time in any twelve (12) month period. If any such audit reveals that Customer has used the Commercial Software in excess of the limitations set forth in the Agreement, the Licence or the EULA, the Customer agrees to promptly pay to ObjectBox an amount equal to the difference between the Subscription Fees actually paid and the Subscription Fees that Customer should have paid to remain in compliance with such limitations (in addition to any other rights that ObjectBox may have to suspend performance of the Support Services or enforce its rights in relation to ObjectBox’s breach). This Section 1.4 shall survive for a period of one (1) year from the termination or expiration of the Agreement.

1.5 <ins>Government Rights.</ins> The Commercial Software is “Commercial Computer Software,” as defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101, and as used in 48 C.F.R.

1.6 <ins>Post Termination or Expiration.</ins> Upon termination or expiration of the Agreement, any applicable Subscription Term or Order Form, for any reason, Customer shall promptly cease the use of the Commercial Software the Download Link, any Confidential Information and related documents and copies and destroy (and certify to ObjectBox in writing the fact of such destruction), or return to ObjectBox, all copies of the Commercial Software and related Documentation then in Customer’s possession or under Customer’s control. Sections 1.3, 1.4, 1.6, 2 and 3 shall survive termination or expiration of this Licence.
